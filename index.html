             <!-- <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3> -->
             <br>
                <h4>Shaker</h4>
                <p>
                    Shakers are used to mix ingredients together by shaking them. They are typically made of stainless steel, but can also be made of glass or plastic
                </p>
                <h4>Strainer</h4>
                <p>
                    Strainers are used to separate the liquid from the ice and other solid ingredients. There are different types of strainers, such as the Hawthorne strainer and the Julep strainer.
                </p>
                <h4>Jigger/shot glass</h4>
                <p>
                    used for measuring
                </p>
                <h4>Mixing glass</h4>
                <p>
                    not all cocktails are shaken
                </p>
                <h4>Bar spoon</h4>
                <p>
                    making drinks and measuring small quantities
                </p>
                <h4>Muddler</h4>
                <p>
                    tool used to mash fruits or herbs
                </p>
                <h4>Citrus squeezer</h4>
                <p>
                    press a lemon
                </p>
                <h4>Blender</h4>
                <p>
                    to make blended drinks
                </p>

        <button class="accordion">GLASSWARE</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <!-- <h3>Glassware</h3> -->
            <br>
               <h4>Highball/Collins glass</h4>
               <p>
                   Highball and Collins glass are very similar and are often used interchangeably. Both are tall, narrow glasses meant for serving mixed drinks (though the Collins glass is somewhat narrower and taller.)
               </p>
               <h4>Martini/cocktail glass</h4>
               <p>
                   Like highball and Collins glasses, Martini and cocktail glasses aren't much different from one another, and you likely already think of them both as Martini glasses. They're conical in shape and meant for cocktails served straight up without ice.
               </p>
               <h4>Old Fashioned/rocks glass</h4>
               <p>
                   Old Fashion glasses (sometimes called lowball glasses) are short and typically used for drinks served on ice- hence why they're also called rocks glasses.
               </p>
               <h4>Coupe</h4>
               <p>
                   Coupe glasses were originally designed to serve champagne, but the wide mouth isn't that great for bubbles. Today, they're a popular choice for mixed drinks served straght up.
               </p>
               <h4>Champagne flute</h4>
               <p>
                   Flutes are tall, slender glasses with small mouths designed to retain the bubbles in sparkling drinks. They're great for any cocktail made with sparkling wine.
               </p>
               <h4>Margarita glass</h4>
               <p>
                   You can serve a Margarita in different types of glass (on the rocks, they're often served in a rocks glass, or for fancier setting a cocktail glass), but its namesake glass is a more curvaceous version of a cocktail glass.
               </p>
               <h4>Moscow Mule mug</h4>
               <p>
                   A Moscow Mule is traditionally served in a copper mug with a handle. Make sure you get one thats lined with another metal, like stainless steel, as acidic drinks (such as mules) erode the copper.
               </p>
               <h4>Hurricane glass</h4>
               <p>
                   Hurricane glasses have a distinct tulip shape and are used to serve tropical or tiki drinks. Their little cousin is the Poco Grande, a slightly smaller glass often used for Pina Colodas.
               </p>
               <h4>Wine glass</h4>
               <p>
                   Sure, wine glasses are for wine, but they're used for wine cocktails, too, including Sangria.
               </p>
               <h4>Mason jar</h4>
               <p>
                   Mason jars are used for canning and preserving food, but lately, they've become a hip vessel for serving cocktails. Bonus: if you pop a lid on, you can take your drink with you for a picnic.
               </p>
               <h4>Teaup</h4>
               <p>
                   During the 1920s Prohibiton era in the US, alcohol was sometimes sneakily served in teacups. Now, it's a trendy serving choice that's less anout subterfuge and more about making your cocktails Pinterest-worthy.

        <div class="panel">
        <!-- <h3>Types of Alcohol</h3> -->
        <br>
           <h4>Whiskey</h4>
           <p>
               Nobody can agree on how to spell whiskey (or whisky), but its rich flavor has madce it one of the most popular kinds of liquor used in cocktails. Whiskey is distilled from different types of grain-barley, corn, rye, or wheat-and then aged in oak barrels. The most common are Scotch (malted grain whiskies made in Scotland and aged for a minimum of three years), bourbon (American whiskeys made from corn), and rye (made from rye, and often produced in Canada or the US). Famous whiskey cocktails include the Old Fashioned, Manhattan, and Whiskey Sour.
           </p>
           <h4>Gin</h4>
           <p>
               Gin is a clear alcohol defined by the flavor of juniper berries. Some gins add juniper post-distillation, while others (distilled gins and London dry gins) involve it in the distillation process. WHile gin has to taste prodominately of juniper in order to be considered gin, it often features other botanical flavors too, including citrus, anise, coriander, cucumber, and rose petals. It's a favorite with bartenders, and you can find it in drinks like the Negroni, Martini, and French75.
           </p>
           <h4>Rum</h4>
           <p>
               Rum is distilled from sugarcane or molasses and has a rich, sugary flavor. There are many different varieties, from light rum (which is basically clear) to dark rum (whichis full-bodied, and often consumed straight up). It's predominately produced in the Carribean and Latin America, and is often used in cocktails with a tropical flavor: Mai Tais, Mojitos, and Daquiris. A close cousin to rum is cachaca, which is produced in Brazil from fermented sugarcane juice and used in Caipirinhas.
           </p>
           <h4>Vodka</h4>
           <p>
               Vodka is the most neutral spirit, clear and almost flavorless. It's dominant spirit of Russia and Scandinavia. Famous vodka cocktails include the Moscow Mule, White Russian, and Vodka Martini.
